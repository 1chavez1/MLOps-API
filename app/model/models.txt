In the first step, we create a dedicated sentiment analysis file (PyTorch file as torch.jit) using our own methods.
We start by collecting data through web scraping. This data is then cleaned and preprocessed using an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load),
process to ensure its consistency and quality. 
After cleaning, we apply a vectorizer to convert the text into numerical representations,
which are then used by the prediction function to perform sentiment analysis.
